\section{Equivalence Theorem} \label{equivalencetheorem}
One of the foundations of Linear Algebra is how all of these properties of a
matrix relate to each other.

\begin{theorem}
For a square matrix $A$ of arbitrary size, all of the following statements are
equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $A$ is invertible
    \item $A$ is row-equivalent to  $I_n$ 
    \item $\det{A} \neq 0$
    \item $Ax = 0$ only has the trivial solution
    \item $AX=B$ is consistent for every choice of $B$ 
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
