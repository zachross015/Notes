\section{Systems of Linear Equations}

A \emph{linear equation} is defined as an equation between two variables that gives
a straight line when plotted on a graph. This can be show by the equation
that follows: 
\begin{equation}a_1x_1 + a_2x_2+\ldots+a_nx_n=b\end{equation}
Where we refer to $a$ as a coefficient, $b$ as a constant, and $x$ as a an unknown.

We can have multiple linear equations, which form a system of linear
equations when put together. This is generally expressed as such:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2+&\ldots+a_{1n}x_n  = b_1\\
        a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2+&\ldots+a_{2n}x_n  = b_2\\
                              &\vdots\\
        a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2+&\ldots+a_{mn}x_n  = b_m\\
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
